abstract = {We present the Constrained Bi-directional Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT) algorithm for planning paths in configuration spaces with multiple constraints. This algorithm provides a general framework for handling a variety of constraints in manipulation planning including torque limits, constraints on the pose of an object held by a robot, and constraints for following workspace surfaces. CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to find bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint. We demonstrate the CBiRRT on a 7DOF WAM arm with a 4DOF Barrett hand on a mobile base. The planner allows this robot to perform household tasks, solve puzzles, and lift heavy objects.},

abstract = {Sidewinding is an efficient gait adopted by biological and robotic snakes for locomoting on various terrains. The mechanics of this motion on flat ground and steady state terrains have been thoroughly investigated, while its capability to adapt to changing environments is not as well studied. We demonstrate the capability of a snake robot to automatically adjust gait parameters to optimally move up and down slopes of varying angle. This capability is achieved by three components. First, an efficient offline learning algorithm finds a policy mapping the estimated slope angle to the optimal gait parameters. Next, a robust online state estimation technique infers the local terrain characteristics. Finally, the precomputed policy is consulted online to select the optimal gait parameters for this slope. The efficacy of this approach is verified by robot experiments.},

The actuator modeling design and mechanics are introduced. Experimental and simulation data are used in order to determine the design specifications of the actuator for its use in a knee exoskeleton system. Finally an assistive control strategy is introduced that will allow the proposed system to provide motion assistance to the subject knee.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of using real-time feedback from contact sensors to create closed-loop pushing actions. To do so, we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with a transition model based on a physics simulator and a reward function that drives the robot towards a successful grasp. We demonstrate that it is intractable to solve the full POMDP with traditional techniques and introduce a novel decomposition of the policy into pre- and post- contact stages to reduce the computational complexity. Our method uses an offline point-based solver on a variable-resolution discretization of the state space to solve for a post-contact policy as a pre-computation step. Then, at runtime, we use an A* search to compute a pre-contact trajectory. We prove that the value of the resulting policy is within a bound of the value of the optimal policy and give intuition about when it performs well. Additionally, we show the policy produced by our algorithm achieves a successful grasp more quickly and with higher probability than a baseline policy.},

@article{Mordatch2012,
abstract = {We present a motion synthesis framework capable of producing a wide variety of important human behaviors that have rarely been studied, including getting up from the ground, crawling, climbing, moving heavy objects, acrobatics (hand-stands in particular), and various cooperative actions involving two characters and their ma- nipulation of the environment. Our framework is not specific to humans, but applies to characters of arbitrary morphology and limb configuration. The approach is fully automatic and does not require domain knowledge specific to each behavior. It also does not re- quire pre-existing examples or motion capture data. At the core of our framework is the contact-invariant optimization (CIO) method we introduce here. It enables simultaneous optimiza- tion of contact and behavior. This is done by augmenting the search space with scalar variables that indicate whether a potential contact should be active in a given phase of the movement. These auxil- iary variables affect not only the cost function but also the dynam- ics (by enabling and disabling contact forces), and are optimized together with the movement trajectory. Additional innovations in- clude a continuation scheme allowing helper forces at the potential contacts rather than the torso, as well as a feature-based model of physics which is particularly well-suited to the CIO framework. We expect that CIO can also be used with a full physics model, but leave that extension for future work.},

abstract = {Humans are capable of manipulating objects based solely on the sense of touch. For robots to achieve the same feat in unstructured environments, global localization of objects via touch is required. Bayesian approaches provide the means to cope with uncertainties of the real world, but the estimation of the Bayesian posterior for the full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) global localization problem is computationally prohibitive. We propose an efficient Bayesian approach termed Scaling Series. It is capable of solving the full problem reliably in real time. This is a Monte Carlo approach that performs a series of successive refinements coupled with annealing. We also propose an analytical measurement model, which can be computed efficiently at run time for any object represented as a polygonal mesh. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that Scaling Series drastically outperforms prior approaches. We demonstrate general applicability of the approach on five common solid objects, which are rigidly fixed during the experiments. We also consider 6-DOF localization and tracking of free-standing objects that can move during tactile exploration.},

abstract = {Snake robots, sometimes called hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotive capabilities. These capabilities are ideally suited for disaster response because the snake robot can thread through tightly packed volumes, accessing locations that people and conventional machinery otherwise cannot. Snake robots also have the advantage of possessing a variety of locomotion capabilities that conventional robots do not. Just like their biological counterparts, snake robots achieve these locomotion capabilities using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which, in turn, causes a net motion, say forward, lateral and rotational, for the snake robot. The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: parameterized and scripted. The parameterized gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a relative simple parameterized function, whereas the scripted cannot.
