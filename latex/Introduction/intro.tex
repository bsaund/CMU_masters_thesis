Contacting the world can provide stability, support, and sensory information.
Humans benefit from touching the world in situations from blindly detecting an object in the back of the refrigerator, to leaning on a stair railing. 
In the recent DARPA robotics challenge top robotics research teams from around the world submitted robots to attempt an obstacle course of challenges.
Many of these robots fell on the stairs. 
Not a single robot used the railing \cite{Atkeson2015}.
Even drunk people know to use railings, so there is plenty of room for improvement in robotics.

However, in robotics there are good reasons to avoid contact with the environment.
Hitting the world can provide large forces that destabilize or break the robot.
Relying on contacts can be dangerous as slight alterations in the world or errors in robot position may drastically alter the contact forces.
Instead of firmly grasping a handle, a few centimeters of error have caused robots to embarrassingly grasp air and fall over \cite{DarpaRoboticsVideo}.
Even when working entirely in simulation contacts between rigid bodies cause problems for physics engines.


Contacts introduce non-smooth discontinuities, which presents a challenge for many tools in the roboticists arsenal.
The benefits of contacts occur on a measure-zero manifold in the robot's configuration space.
For example, hand rests comfortably on a table at a specific configuration of shoulder, elbow, and wrist positions.
A slight extension of the elbow while fixing all other joints leads to the hand puncturing the table, while a slight contractions pulls the hand into the air and the table might as well not exist.
Random sampling and gradient decent are two techniques that appear in the solution to many robotics challenges, but both have difficulty with these measure-zero contact manifolds.
This thesis explores and extends techniques of sampling based and gradient methods to the problems of localization and planning, with the addition of contact forces and measurements.


%% Standard numerical techniques of discretization fail to capture the near instantaneous effects of contact both in modeling uncertainty and planning.


\section{Motivation}
My personal motivation for the topics covered in this thesis come, in part, from my past experience as a robotics engineering building robots that build airplanes.
Currently, large robotic arms equipped with expensive, specialized end effectors perform a variety of tasks for aerospace manufacturing, including drilling holes, inserting fasteners, milling, carbon fiber placement and layup, and sealant application.
While there are many potential directions of research to improve these already impressive machines, two striking issues are addressed by my work.

\subsection{Jigs are More Expensive Than Robots}

\begin{figure}

  \end{subfigure}
  \label{fig:KukaRobots}
  \caption{Robots working on the outside of parts held firmly in jigs}
\end{figure}

Robots that perform one type of task on one section of an airplane can cost millions of dollars.
However the jig that holds the airplane section while the robot works can cost more than the robot.
These jigs may have more actuators and tighter tolarances than the robotic system.
When the robot begins work on a new section, before ever making a measurement the jig has already located the part to within a few inches.
A few scripted measurement with a probe, programmed by an engineer, are sufficient to fully localize the part to within the needed tolerances.
%% These high costs and skilled engineering time are only acceptable because the expense is amortized over many
When amortized over many airplanes the per-part cost drops.
However, this process is inflexible and poorly suited to low-rate manufacturing.

If the robot could localize the part from a wide range of part configurations, and if the robot could reason about interal assembly tolerances then jigs could be make more cheaply, robots would become more versitile, less part-specific programming would be required, and machining accuracy could improve.

\subsection{Robots Stay on the Outside}

  \caption{Workers crawling in the confined spaces of an airplane wing}
\end{figure}

Large robotic arms cannot fit in the convined spaces of an aircraft.
While a team of people may include workers on both the inside and outside, large robots are limited to just the outside.



\section{Approach}
The work in this thesis address two separate problems. The first is the task of localizing an object through measurements made using contact measurement.
The second is the task of planning a trajectory for a robotic arm that is too long to support its own cantilevered weight, and so must rest on the environment for support.
Unifying the two problems is the challenges associated with contacts.

\subsection{Localization}

\end{figure}

The in localization task the robot must esxtimates the pose $X$ of an object based on a set of measurements $Z_t = \{z_1, ..., z_t\}$ made by probing the object.
The robot chooses where to probe, and the measurements are a function of the object and chosen measurement action.
A triangular mesh describes the object geometry and a frame is attached to this mesh. 
The state $X$ is the $SE(3)$ transformation from a fixed world frame to this part frame. 
This is a 6-dimensional state stored as position $(x,y,z)$ and orientation angles $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$. 
Initially it is assumed the geometry is rigid, thus the state can be fully described as the $SE(3)$ configuration of a frame attached to the part \ref{sec:rigid_body}.
Later, this is generalized to parts with internal uncertainty \ref{sec:datum}.
A further assume is that the part is fixed in space relative to a world frame and that probing actions do not perturb the state. 

Rather than calculating a single best estimate of the pose, a probability distribution represents the uncertainty in knowledge.
Estimating the probability distribution is important both for choosing effective measurements and knowing when the part is localized sufficiently. 
For feasibility, this probabilistic belief is represented numerically by a list of points drawn from the true distribution called \textit{particles}. 
A measurement updates the belief using a \textit{particle filter} \cite{Thrun2000a}.

However particle filters behave poorly both when the dimensionallity of the system grows large and when measurements become precise \cite{Koval2013}. 
In the problems considered there is a large initial uncertainty, and achieving high tolerance performance necessitates measurements with low uncertainty.
Updating the belief after performing such a measurement will eliminate most particles, leaving a poor representation of the posterior. This problem is called particle starvation.

This thesis first presents a solution to particle starvation during touch localization (section \ref{sec:rigid_body}) using a particle filter with an alternate update procedure that is able to combine accurate measurements with the prior. 
This particle filter is then generalized to parts with internal uncertainty (section \ref{sec:datum}).

To minimize the time taken to localize the part, the robot should choose informative measurement actions.
To achieve this, many actions are sampled and the one with the highest expected \textit{information gain} is selected. 
Fully predicting this is also computationally expensive, thus previous methods using this metric introduce delays during which the robot pauses between measurements and yet still only samples a small number of actions.
This approach involves a fast approximation for information gain that takes advantage of the discretized belief from the particle filter (section \ref{sec:information gain}). 
This enables the sampling hundreds of potential measurement actions in a few seconds. 



%% At any time step we have a belief of the state $bel(x_t) = p(x_t| Z_t)$. 
%% Measurements are a non-linear probabilistic function of the true state: $z_t \sim p(z_t|X)$. 
%% As in all Bayesian filters, the belief $bel(x_{t+1})$ is calculated recursively as follows \footnote{The full update of a Bayesian filter also includes a process model. Our assumption of a fixed part yields the static process model and this simpler formulation}:
%% \begin{align}
%% bel(x_{t+1}) \leftarrow \eta \ p(z_t|x_t) \  bel(x_t)
%% \end{align}
%% with $\eta$ as a normalization factor. Each new measurement value triggers an update to the belief $bel(x)$. 

Figure \ref{fig:Rigid:Overview} shows the experimental setup.
A 7-DOF robotic arm equiped with a touch probe performs measurements on an object \subcap{fig:Rigid:Overview_1}.
These measurements are used to update the belief \subcap{fig:Rigid:Overview_2}. The belief is the used to determine good information gathering future measurement actions.
