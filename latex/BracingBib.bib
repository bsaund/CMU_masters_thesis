abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {We present the Constrained Bi-directional Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT) algorithm for planning paths in configuration spaces with multiple constraints. This algorithm provides a general framework for handling a variety of constraints in manipulation planning including torque limits, constraints on the pose of an object held by a robot, and constraints for following workspace surfaces. CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to find bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint. We demonstrate the CBiRRT on a 7DOF WAM arm with a 4DOF Barrett hand on a mobile base. The planner allows this robot to perform household tasks, solve puzzles, and lift heavy objects.},

abstract = {We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking on uneven terrain with obsta- cles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware. Our implementation is available within the Drake MATLAB toolbox.},

abstract = {Constructing climbing behaviors for hyper-redundant robots that account for the system dynamics requires a model of robot dynamics under contact and friction. One common model, rigid-body dynamics with coulomb friction, unfortunately is both an ambiguous and inconsistent set of dynamic axioms. This paper addresses the ambiguity problem by developing an algorithm which computes the set of joint torques such that all solutions are guaranteed to produce the desired system behavior. This algorithm is applied to a type of robot climbing which we denote climbing via bracing where a hyper-redundant robot stabilizes itself against gravity by pressing outward to induce friction. By bracing with a fraction of the robot, which we term a brace the remainder of the robot remains free to move upward and brace at a higher location. A sequence of braces thus moves the robot upward.},

The dynamic equations of the motion with multiple contact constraints are derived. The dynamic equations are transformed into two subspaces (the constrained and constraint-free subspace) using singular value decomposition of the constraint equations. Each force and position controller is developed based on the orthogonality of these two subspaces. A hybrid controller is proposed from the new coordinates. Its stability is proved analytically under the quasi-static condition. An experimental study is carried out to justify the feasibility and application of the proposed ideas},

@article{Bretl2006,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a multi-limbed robot in order to ¡°free-climb ¡± vertical rock surfaces. Free-climbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might have future consequences. In this paper, this process of reasoning is broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a free-climbing robot's configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact between the robot and its environment. A multi-step planning framework is presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called lemur (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at nasa-jpl). Using the planner presented in this paper, lemur free-climbed an indoor, near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features. 1},

abstract = {Previous work on coarse-fine robots has emphasized improved positioning resolution or improved compliant behavior. The authors stress the use of the coarse-fine system's redundant degrees of freedom for bracing of either the coarse or the fine manipulator to execute an assembly task reliably. They refer to real bracing if the constraining forces and torques are supplied by mechanical means, and to virtual bracing if they are supplied by a control system. An application of the coarse-fine robot bracing approach to precision laminate registration and stacking for electronic packaging is presented. Results show that assembly errors of only a few microns can be readily obtained, approximately an order of magnitude improvement over the unbraced coarse-fine case, and nearly two orders of magnitude better than those attainable by coarse manipulation alone},

@article{Posa2013,
abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to motion planning using a stochastic trajectory optimization framework. The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.},

abstract = {We present a motion synthesis framework capable of producing a wide variety of important human behaviors that have rarely been studied, including getting up from the ground, crawling, climbing, moving heavy objects, acrobatics (hand-stands in particular), and various cooperative actions involving two characters and their ma- nipulation of the environment. Our framework is not specific to humans, but applies to characters of arbitrary morphology and limb configuration. The approach is fully automatic and does not require domain knowledge specific to each behavior. It also does not re- quire pre-existing examples or motion capture data. At the core of our framework is the contact-invariant optimization (CIO) method we introduce here. It enables simultaneous optimiza- tion of contact and behavior. This is done by augmenting the search space with scalar variables that indicate whether a potential contact should be active in a given phase of the movement. These auxil- iary variables affect not only the cost function but also the dynam- ics (by enabling and disabling contact forces), and are optimized together with the movement trajectory. Additional innovations in- clude a continuation scheme allowing helper forces at the potential contacts rather than the torso, as well as a feature-based model of physics which is particularly well-suited to the CIO framework. We expect that CIO can also be used with a full physics model, but leave that extension for future work.},

abstract = {A new type of wearable robot that assists the wearer with extra arms secured around the hips is presented. Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},
